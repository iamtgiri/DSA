Problem: Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-flips-to-make-a-or-b-equal-to-c/description/

Problem Statement:
Given three positive integers a, b, and c. In one operation, you can flip any bit
in a or b (i.e., change 0 to 1 or 1 to 0). Return the minimum number of flips
required so that (a OR b) == c.

-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: Iterating through all possible combinations of flips (which is up to 64 flips total for 32-bit integers) is computationally infeasible. The core logic must focus on the bit level.
- Time complexity: N/A (Exponential if attempted)
- Space complexity: N/A
- Limitations: The problem structure forces a bitwise-greedy solution.

‚úÖ Optimized Approachs
- Idea: Since bitwise OR operations are independent for each bit position, the problem can be solved by processing the numbers bit-by-bit from LSB to MSB and greedily finding the minimum flips required at each position.
- Approach: Bitwise Iteration (Greedy).
- Algorithm:
    1. Initialize `flips = 0`.
    2. Loop while at least one of `a`, `b`, or `c` is greater than 0.
    3. Extract the Least Significant Bit (LSB) for $a, b,$ and $c$ using the bitwise AND operator (`& 1`).
    4. **Determine flips based on the target $c_{bit}$:**
        * If **$c_{bit}$ is 1**: The current result $(a_{bit} | b_{bit})$ must be 1. If it's 0 (meaning $a_{bit}=0$ and $b_{bit}=0$), we need exactly one flip on $a$ or $b$. $\implies$ `flips += 1`.
        * If **$c_{bit}$ is 0**: The current result $(a_{bit} | b_{bit})$ must be 0. We need to flip every 1 to a 0. If $a_{bit}=1$ and $b_{bit}=1$, we need two flips. If only one is 1, we need one flip. $\implies$ `flips += a_{bit} + b_{bit}$.
    5. Right-shift all three numbers (`>>= 1`) to process the next bit.
- Time complexity: $O(\log(\max(a, b, c)))$, which is $O(1)$ given the 32-bit integer constraint.
- Space complexity: $O(1)$.

üí° Key Pattern:
- **Bitwise Independence:** Bitwise operations allow for highly efficient, greedy solutions by treating each bit position as a separate, local subproblem.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- Bitwise Operations, Greedy Algorithm, LSB, Bit Manipulation.

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- The core logic is the case when $c_{bit}=0$. If both $a_{bit}$ and $b_{bit}$ are 1, you must flip both, costing 2 flips. If $c_{bit}=1$ and both $a_{bit}$ and $b_{bit}$ are 0, you only need to flip one, costing 1 flip.
