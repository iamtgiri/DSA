Problem: Word Ladder
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/description/

Problem Statement:
Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, find
the length of the shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`
such that:
1. Only one letter can be changed at each step.
2. Each intermediate word must exist in the `wordList`.
If no such sequence exists, return 0.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: Recursively explore all possible valid paths from `startWord` to
  `targetWord` using DFS or exhaustive path checking, without prioritizing
  shorter paths.
- Time complexity: Exponential, potentially O(N!). Highly dependent on the graph structure.
- Space complexity: O(N * L) for storing paths, where N is the number of words
  and L is the word length.
- Limitations: Extremely inefficient and prone to Time Limit Exceeded (TLE).

‚úÖ Optimized Approachs
- Idea: The problem asks for the **shortest path** in an unweighted graph (where
  words are nodes and single-letter changes are edges). **BFS** is optimal for
  shortest path in unweighted graphs.
- Approach: Breadth-First Search (BFS) using neighbor generation.
- Algorithm:
  1. Store `wordList` in an **unordered_set** (`words`) for O(1) lookup and deletion.
  2. Use a **queue** to store `(word, length)` pairs, starting with `(startWord, 1)`.
  3. In the BFS loop, for the current `node`, generate all possible **one-letter** mutations.
  4. For each mutation:
     a. If it equals `targetWord`, return `length + 1`.
     b. If it exists in the `words` set, enqueue it with `length + 1` and remove
        it from the set to mark it as visited.
- Time complexity: O(N * L^2). N is number of words, L is word length. For each
  word, we check L positions, and for each position, we try 26 letters. String
  operations (creation/lookup) take O(L). Total: O(N * L * 26 * L) simplified
  to **O(N * L^2)** (where 26 is a constant).
- Space complexity: O(N * L) for the word set and the queue.

üí° Key Pattern:
- **Shortest Path in Unweighted Graph:** The requirement for the "shortest"
  sequence is the definitive signal to use **BFS**.
- **On-the-fly Graph Construction:** Instead of pre-building a full graph
  adjacency list, generate neighbors (one-letter diff words) dynamically during
  the BFS traversal.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- BFS, Shortest Path, Graph Traversal, Word Transformation, Hash Set, Queue.

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- Using `unordered_set` is crucial for performance.
- Deleting visited words (`words.erase(temp)`) prevents cycles and redundant work.
- The same problem can be solved with **Bi-directional BFS**, which can offer
  significant speedup by meeting in the middle.
