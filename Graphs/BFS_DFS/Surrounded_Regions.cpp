Problem: Surrounded Regions
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/description/

Problem Statement:
Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that
are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.
A region is captured by flipping all contained 'O's to 'X's.
A region is NOT captured if it is on the border or connected to the border
(i.e., it is "safe").

Example:
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],
                ["X","O","O","X"],
                ["X","X","O","X"],
                ["X","O","X","X"]]
                
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],
         ["X","X","X","X"],
         ["X","X","X","X"],
         ["X","O","X","X"]]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: For every 'O' in the inner part of the board, run a separate BFS or DFS
  to check if it connects to any 'O' on the border.
- Time complexity: O((m*n)^2). Up to O(m*n) 'O' cells, each taking O(m*n) to
  check reachability.
- Space complexity: O(m*n) for recursion stack or auxiliary visited array.
- Limitations: Extremely inefficient due to redundant checks.

‚úÖ Optimized Approach
- Idea: Instead of checking which regions are surrounded, identify which regions
  are NOT surrounded (i.e., safe) by starting a flood-fill from the boundary 'O's.
- Approach: Multi-Source BFS / Boundary Flood Fill
- Algorithm:
  1. Use 'B' (Boundary-safe) as a temporary marker.
  2. Initialize a queue with all 'O' cells located on the grid border. Change
     these border 'O's to 'B's.
  3. Run BFS/Flood Fill from these sources, changing all connected 'O's to 'B's.
  4. Finally, iterate through the entire board:
     - Flip remaining 'O's to 'X's (they are surrounded).
     - Flip all 'B's back to 'O's (they are safe).
- Time complexity: O(m*n). Each cell is visited and processed at most once.
- Space complexity: O(m*n) for the BFS queue.

üí° Key Pattern:
- Connectivity problems involving boundaries: Flood-fill/BFS/DFS from the
  boundaries inwards to mark "exposed" or "safe" areas first.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- BFS, Multi-Source, Grid Traversal, Flood Fill, In-place Modification

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- The temporary marker ('B' in this case) is crucial for distinguishing between
  surrounded 'O's and boundary-connected 'O's.
- The two-pass approach (boundary check then final flip) ensures correctness.
