Problem: Covid Spread
Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/covid-spread--141631/1

Problem Statement:
Given a 2D grid representing a hospital ward where 0 is an empty bed, 1 is a 
healthy patient, and 2 is an infected patient. An infected patient spreads the 
virus to adjacent healthy patients (up, down, left, right) in one unit of time.
Find the minimum time required to infect all healthy patients. If it's impossible, 
return -1.

-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: Simulate the spread minute by minute. In each time unit, iterate through 
  the entire grid to find all newly infected patients from the previous step. 
  Repeat until no new patients are infected.
- Time complexity: O(T * R * C), where T is the maximum possible time (up to R*C).
- Space complexity: O(1) auxiliary space (if modifying the grid in place).
- Limitations: Can be inefficient if the maximum time T is large.

‚úÖ Optimized Approachs
- Idea: This is a shortest path problem (minimum time to reach all 1s from the 
  nearest 2). Multi-source BFS is the ideal technique to solve this.
- Approach: Multi-Source Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- Algorithm:
    1. **Initialization:** Count total healthy patients (`uninfected`). Initialize 
       a queue with coordinates of all initially infected patients (2s).
    2. **BFS Traversal:** Process the queue layer by layer (time unit by time unit).
        a. Use the queue size at the start of a layer to delimit the current time step.
        b. For each infected patient, check its four neighbors. If a neighbor is 
           a healthy patient (1), infect them (change to 2), decrement 
           `uninfected` count, and add them to the queue.
        c. If any new patient was infected in this layer, increment the time.
    3. **Result:** After the queue is empty, if `uninfected` is 0, return `time`. 
       Otherwise, return -1.
- Time complexity: O(R * C). Each cell is visited and processed exactly once.
- Space complexity: O(R * C) to store the queue in the worst case.

üí° Key Pattern:
- **Multi-Source BFS:** Used for finding the shortest time/distance from any of 
  multiple starting points (all initial 2s) to all reachable targets (all 1s).

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- BFS, Multi-Source, Grid Traversal, Shortest Time, Matrix.

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- The BFS structure naturally handles the "minimum time" requirement by processing 
  neighbors layer by layer.
