Problem: Cycle Detection in an Undirected Graph
Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-cycle-in-an-undirected-graph/1

Problem Statement:
Given an undirected graph with V vertices and E edges, check whether it
contains any cycle. The graph may be disconnected.

-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- A naive approach is not practical here. Standard graph traversals like BFS
  and DFS are already the most efficient ways to solve this problem.

‚úÖ Optimized Approach (DFS)
- Idea: Traverse the graph depth-first. A cycle is detected if we encounter
  a visited vertex that is not the immediate parent of the current vertex.
- Approach: For each unvisited vertex, start a DFS. Pass the parent of the
  current node in the recursion.
- Algorithm:
  1. For each vertex, if not visited, call a recursive `dfs` function.
  2. In `dfs(current, parent)`, mark `current` as visited.
  3. For each neighbor of `current`:
     a. If the neighbor is not visited, recurse: `dfs(neighbor, current)`.
     b. If the neighbor is visited and is not the parent, a cycle exists.
  4. If the loop finishes without finding a cycle, return false.
- Time complexity: O(V + E), where V is vertices and E is edges.
- Space complexity: O(V) for the visited array and recursion stack.

‚úÖ Optimized Approach (BFS)
- Idea: Traverse the graph breadth-first. A cycle is found if we visit a
  node that's already been visited and is not the parent of the current node.
- Approach: For each unvisited vertex, start a BFS. Use a queue that stores
  pairs of `{node, parent}`.
- Algorithm:
  1. For each vertex, if not visited, start a BFS.
  2. Push `{start_node, -1}` to a queue and mark `start_node` as visited.
  3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue `{node, parent}`.
  4. For each neighbor of `node`:
     a. If the neighbor is not visited, mark it and enqueue `{neighbor, node}`.
     b. If the neighbor is visited and is not the `parent`, a cycle exists.
- Time complexity: O(V + E).
- Space complexity: O(V) for the visited array and queue.

üí° Key Pattern:
- Tracking the parent node during a graph traversal (DFS or BFS) to
  differentiate between a path back to the parent and a back-edge to an
  ancestor, which indicates a cycle in an undirected graph.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- Graph, Undirected Graph, Cycle Detection, BFS, DFS, Adjacency List

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- The parent tracking technique is crucial for undirected graphs.
- For disconnected graphs, we must iterate through all vertices and start a
  traversal if a vertex hasn't been visited yet.
