Problem: Word Ladder II
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/description/

Problem Statement:
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return all
the shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord. If no such
sequence exists, return an empty list. Each transformation must only change one
letter, and the resulting word must be in wordList.

-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: Generate *all* possible word transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord using a simple, unbounded DFS or BFS without pruning. Then, find the minimum length and filter the paths.
- Time complexity: Exponential, potentially O(26^L * W), where L is word length and W is word list size.
- Space complexity: O(N * L) for storing all generated paths (N being the total number of paths).
- Limitations: Highly inefficient as it explores paths much longer than the shortest possible sequence, leading to Time Limit Exceeded (TLE).

‚úÖ Optimized Approachs
- Idea: This problem requires a two-step approach: first, **BFS** to find the minimum distance and build the graph structure of all shortest paths; second, **DFS (Backtracking)** to traverse this structure and collect all paths.
- Approach: Bidirectional BFS (often faster but complex) or single-directional BFS + DFS Backtracking (simpler logic). The implemented approach uses BFS + Backtracking.
- Algorithm:
    1. **BFS (Forward)**: Perform a level-order search starting from `beginWord`. In each level, explore neighbors of all words in the current level. If a neighbor is valid (in `wordSet`):
        a. Record the current word as a **parent** of the neighbor in `parentMap`.
        b. Add the neighbor to `nextLevel`.
        c. Mark words in the `currentLevel` as used (remove from `wordSet`) to prevent loops and ensure we only transition to the next level (guaranteeing shortest path length).
        d. Stop BFS immediately when `endWord` is found.
    2. **DFS (Backward)**: Use the `parentMap` (which maps a word to its predecessors on a shortest path) to recursively backtrack from `endWord` to `beginWord`, assembling the paths.
- Time complexity: O(W * L^2 * 26 + N * L), where $W$ is word count, $L$ is word length, and $N$ is the number of resulting shortest paths. BFS dominates the complexity for large dictionaries, proportional to generating the graph $O(V+E)$.
- Space complexity: O(W * L) for the word sets and the `parentMap`. O(N * L) for storing the final results.

üí° Key Pattern:
- **BFS for Shortest Distance, DFS for All Paths.** BFS guarantees the minimum length; DFS/Backtracking enumerates all solutions using that minimum length constraint.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- BFS, DFS, Graph, Shortest Path, Backtracking, Parent Map, Transformation Sequence.

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- It is crucial in BFS to only use words from the current level and not reuse them in subsequent steps, as this guarantees the path taken is the shortest one.

    "a" -> "b" -> "c" (length 3, 2 transformations)
