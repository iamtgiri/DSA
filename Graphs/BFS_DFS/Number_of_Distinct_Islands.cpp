Problem: Number of Distinct Islands
Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/number-of-distinct-islands/1

Problem Statement:
Given a boolean 2D matrix (grid) where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.
An island is a group of connected 1s (horizontally or vertically). Two islands are
considered distinct if they cannot be entirely translated to overlap with each other.
Return the number of distinct island shapes.

-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: Find all islands using DFS/BFS and store their raw absolute coordinates.
- Time complexity: O(N * M)
- Space complexity: O(N * M)
- Limitations: Fails to recognize two identical shapes located at different positions as the same island. Requires coordinate normalization.

‚úÖ Optimized Approachs
- Idea: Normalize the shape of each island by recording the coordinates of its cells relative to a fixed origin (the first cell found). This makes the shape translation-invariant.
- Approach: Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) with Coordinate Normalization.
- Algorithm:
    1. Iterate over the grid. When an unvisited land cell (r0, c0) is found, start traversal.
    2. During traversal, for every cell (r, c), record the relative coordinate (r - r0, c - c0).
    3. Store the resulting sequence of relative coordinates (the shape) in a `std::set`.
    4. The size of the set gives the count of distinct islands.
- Time complexity: O(N * M), as every cell is visited once.
- Space complexity: O(N * M) for the visited array and storing the distinct shapes in the set.

üí° Key Pattern:
- **Normalization for Shape Uniqueness:** To ensure translation invariance, map all component coordinates to be relative to a canonical origin point (the starting cell of the island).

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- Grid Traversal, DFS, BFS, Connected Components, Coordinate Offset, Set.

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- The order of coordinates pushed into the `shape` vector must be consistent (e.g., guaranteed by the fixed order of neighbor exploration in DFS/BFS) for the set to correctly identify identical shapes.
