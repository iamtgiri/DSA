Problem: Flood Fill
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/description/

Problem Statement:
An image is represented by an m x n integer grid `image` where `image[i][j]`
represents the pixel value of the image.

You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. You should perform a
flood fill on the image starting from the pixel `image[sr][sc]`.

To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels
connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the
starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels
(also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all the
aforementioned pixels with `color`.

Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.
-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Similar to the Number of Provinces problem, a standard graph traversal
  is the optimal way to solve this. There isn't a significantly less
  efficient, yet still correct, "brute force" method.

‚úÖ Optimized Approach (BFS)
- Idea: Treat the image grid as a graph where each pixel is a node. An edge
  exists between two pixels if they are adjacent (4-directionally) and have
  the same color.
- Approach: Start a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the starting pixel
  `(sr, sc)`. Find all connected pixels that have the same initial color and
  change their color to the new `color`.
- Algorithm:
  1. Get the initial color of the starting pixel `(sr, sc)`.
  2. If the initial color is already the target color, do nothing.
  3. Create a queue and add the starting pixel `(sr, sc)`.
  4. Change the color of the starting pixel to the new `color`.
  5. While the queue is not empty:
     a. Dequeue a pixel.
     b. For each of its 4-directional neighbors:
     c. If a neighbor is within bounds and has the same original color,
        change its color and enqueue it.
  6. Return the modified image.
- Time complexity: O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the image.
  In the worst case, we visit every pixel once.
- Space complexity: O(m * n). In the worst case, the queue could hold all
  pixels (e.g., a checkerboard pattern).

üí° Key Pattern:
- Using graph traversal (BFS or DFS) on a grid to find a connected region.
- This is a common pattern for problems like "number of islands" or mazes.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- Grid, Matrix, Graph, BFS, DFS, Flood Fill, Connected Components

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- This is a classic algorithm with applications in image processing.
- The base case check `if (tcolor == color)` is crucial to prevent an
  infinite loop if the starting pixel already has the new color.
