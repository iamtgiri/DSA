Problem: DFS Traversal
Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/depth-first-traversal-for-a-graph/1

Problem Statement:
Given a graph (represented by an adjacency list) and a starting node, traverse all
reachable nodes using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm and return the order
in which the nodes are visited.

-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force (N/A)
- Idea: DFS is already an efficient graph traversal technique. Any "brute force"
  would involve redundant operations, but the core time complexity $O(V+E)$ is optimal.
- Time complexity: N/A
- Space complexity: N/A
- Limitations: N/A

‚úÖ Optimized Approachs
- Idea: **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. Explore branches as deeply as possible before
  backtracking. This is typically implemented using recursion or an explicit stack.
- Approach: **Recursive and Iterative Implementations**.
- Algorithm (General):
    1. Start at a given vertex $s$.
    2. Mark $s$ as visited and add it to the result list.
    3. For every unvisited neighbor $v$ of $s$, recursively (or iteratively via stack)
       call the traversal function on $v$.
- Time complexity: **O(V + E)**. Every vertex is visited once, and every edge is examined once.
- Space complexity: **O(V)**. Required for the visited array and the recursion stack (or explicit stack), which in the worst case can hold all $V$ vertices (e.g., a line graph).

üí° Key Pattern:
- **LIFO Exploration:** DFS utilizes a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) structure (stack/recursion)
  to prioritize the deepest nodes in the path before exploring sibling branches.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- Depth-First Search, Graph Traversal, Stack, Recursion, Adjacency List

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- The problem provides both a recursive approach (clean and idiomatic) and an iterative
  approach (avoids stack overflow for very deep graphs). Both yield the same traversal order.
- In the iterative approach, neighbors must be pushed onto the stack in **reverse order** of processing preference (or the adjacency list order) to ensure the LIFO behavior
  matches the path of the recursive version.
