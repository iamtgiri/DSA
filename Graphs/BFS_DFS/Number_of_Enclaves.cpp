Problem: Number of Enclaves
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-enclaves/description/

Problem Statement:
You are given an m x n binary matrix grid, where 0 represents a sea cell and
1 represents a land cell.
A move consists of walking from one land cell to another adjacent (4-directionally)
land cell or walking off the boundary of the grid.
Return the number of land cells that cannot walk off the boundary of the grid.

Example:
Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
Output: 3 (The three '1's in the middle column are trapped)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: For every land cell, run a separate BFS/DFS to check if it can reach
  any border cell.
- Time complexity: O((m*n)^2) - Up to O(m*n) land cells, each taking O(m*n)
  to check reachability.
- Space complexity: O(m*n) for storing distance matrix or visited set per check.
- Limitations: Extremely inefficient due to repeated calculations.

‚úÖ Optimized Approach
- Idea: Instead of checking every land cell, use Multi-Source BFS starting from
  all land cells on the perimeter. Any land cell not visited by this process
  is an enclave.
- Approach: Multi-Source BFS
- Algorithm:
  1. Count `total` number of land cells (1s).
  2. Initialize a queue with all border land cells. Change their value to 2
     (visited/reachable) and decrement `total`.
  3. Perform BFS: From the queue, explore adjacent land cells (1s).
  4. For every newly reached land cell, change its value to 2, enqueue it,
     and decrement `total`.
  5. The final value of `total` is the number of enclaves.
- Time complexity: O(m*n). Each cell is visited and processed exactly once.
- Space complexity: O(m*n) for the BFS queue.

üí° Key Pattern:
- Connectivity problems involving boundaries: Flood-fill/BFS/DFS from the
  boundaries inwards to mark "exposed" areas.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- BFS, Multi-Source, Grid, Flood Fill, Boundary Traversal

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- Reusing the grid (changing 1 to 2) avoids the need for a separate visited array.
- This problem is similar to "Surrounded Regions" (LeetCode 130).
