Problem: Bipartite Graph
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/is-graph-bipartite/description/

Problem Statement:
Given a graph, determine if it is **bipartite**. A graph is bipartite if its
nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets, A and B, such that every
edge connects a node in A to a node in B. Equivalently, no two nodes within the
same set are connected by an edge.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: Try to partition the graph's nodes into every possible combination of
  two sets, and for each partition, check if any edge connects two nodes within
  the same set.
- Time complexity: O(2^V * E). Highly inefficient, as there are $2^V$ ways to
  partition the nodes into two sets.
- Space complexity: O(V) for storing the partition.
- Limitations: Infeasible for any practical graph size (V > 20).

‚úÖ Optimized Approachs
- Idea: A graph is bipartite if and only if it is **2-colorable** and contains
  no **odd-length cycles**. We can use a graph traversal algorithm (BFS or DFS)
  to attempt coloring the graph with two colors.
- Approach: Breadth-First Search (BFS) / Coloring Algorithm.
- Algorithm:
  1. Initialize a `color` array of size `V` with `-1` (uncolored). Use two
     colors, represented by `0` and `1`.
  2. Iterate through all vertices (`start = 0` to `V-1`) to handle potentially
     **disconnected components**.
  3. If `start` is uncolored, start a BFS:
     a. Enqueue `start` and set its color to `0`.
     b. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the current `node`.
     c. For every `neighbor` of `node`:
        i. **Uncolored Neighbor:** Color the neighbor with the opposite color
           (`1 - color[node]`) and enqueue it.
        ii. **Already Colored Neighbor:** Check if the neighbor's color is the
            same as the current node's color. If `color[nei] == color[node]`,
            a conflict is found (an odd-length cycle), so return `false`.
  4. If the traversal finishes without finding any conflicts, return `true`.
- Time complexity: O(V + E). The traversal visits every vertex (V) and every
  edge (E) exactly once, making it optimal for graph traversal problems.
- Space complexity: O(V) for the `color` array and O(V) for the BFS queue. Total
  space complexity is **O(V + E)** to account for the input graph storage.

üí° Key Pattern:
- **Two-Coloring / Odd Cycle Detection:** Bipartite problems are fundamentally
  solved by attempting to color the graph with two colors, ensuring neighbors
  always have different colors. A coloring failure means an odd cycle exists.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- Bipartite, Two-Coloring, Graph Traversal, BFS, Odd Cycle, Disconnected Components.

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- The coloring technique (using `1 - color[node]`) elegantly toggles between
  color 0 and color 1.
- The need to iterate over all nodes (`start`) is crucial for graphs that are
  not fully connected.
