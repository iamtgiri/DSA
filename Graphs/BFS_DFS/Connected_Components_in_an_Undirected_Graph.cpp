Problem: Connected Components in an Undirected Graph
Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/1

Problem Statement:
Given an undirected graph with V vertices and E edges, the goal is to find all
disjoint **Connected Components**. A connected component is a maximal set of vertices
in which every vertex is reachable from every other vertex within the set.

-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force (N/A)
- Idea: Graph traversal is inherently the most efficient way to solve this. No common
  "brute force" exists that is asymptotically slower than O(V+E) unless unnecessary
  operations are introduced.

‚úÖ Optimized Approachs
- Idea: Utilize a **Graph Traversal Algorithm (BFS or DFS)** to explore the graph.
  Each time the traversal algorithm is launched from an unvisited node, it discovers a
  new, complete connected component.
- Approach: **Iterative Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.
- Algorithm:
    1. Construct the **Adjacency List** from the list of edges.
    2. Iterate through every vertex $i$ from 0 to $V-1$.
    3. If vertex $i$ has not been visited, it marks the start of a new component.
    4. Start a **BFS** from $i$, collecting all reachable nodes into a temporary component list.
    5. Mark all nodes found during the BFS as visited.
    6. Add the collected component to the final result list.
- Time complexity: **O(V + E)**. Every vertex (V) is added to the queue and processed once, and every edge (E) is checked once, leading to linear time complexity based on graph size.
- Space complexity: **O(V + E)**. Primarily for the adjacency list $O(V+E)$, the visited array $O(V)$, and the BFS queue $O(V)$.

üí° Key Pattern:
- **Exhaustive Traversal:** To find all disjoint structures in a graph, run a traversal (BFS/DFS) across all vertices, starting a new search only from nodes that haven't been visited yet.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- Connected Component, Undirected Graph, Graph Traversal, BFS, Adjacency List

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- The problem is typically solved by either BFS, DFS, or the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure. BFS/DFS provides the actual list of nodes in each component, while DSU efficiently counts the number of components.
