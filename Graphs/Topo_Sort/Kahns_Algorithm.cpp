Problem: Kahn's Algorithm (Topological Sort)
Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/topological-sort/1

Problem Statement:
Given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with V vertices and E edges, find a
topological sorting of the graph using Kahn's Algorithm (BFS). A topological
sort is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge
from node u to node v, u comes before v in the ordering. This algorithm can
also detect cycles.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: Iterating through all V! possible permutations of vertices and checking
  if any permutation satisfies the topological ordering criteria.
- Time complexity: O(V! * E). Highly inefficient due to checking every permutation.
- Space complexity: O(V) to store the current permutation.
- Limitations: Infeasible for graphs with more than a few nodes.

‚úÖ Optimized Approachs
- Idea: The core idea of Kahn's Algorithm is to process nodes that have no
  prerequisites (i.e., an in-degree of zero). Once processed, we remove them and
  update the in-degree of their neighbors, potentially creating new nodes with
  an in-degree of zero.
- Approach: Kahn's Algorithm (BFS-based Topological Sort).
- Algorithm:
  1. Calculate the **in-degree** (number of incoming edges) for every vertex.
  2. Initialize a **queue** and add all vertices with an in-degree of 0 to it.
  3. Initialize an empty **result** vector.
  4. While the queue is not empty:
     a. Dequeue a node, `u`, and append it to the `result`.
     b. For every neighbor, `v`, of `u`:
        i. Decrement the in-degree of `v`.
        ii. If the in-degree of `v` becomes 0, enqueue `v`.
  5. After the loop, if the size of the `result` vector is less than V, the
     graph contains a cycle and no topological sort is possible.
- Time complexity: O(V + E). Dominated by iterating through all vertices (V) to
  find initial in-degrees and traversing all edges (E) during the BFS process.
- Space complexity: O(V + E) for the adjacency list and O(V) for the in-degree
  array and the queue. Total space complexity is O(V + E).

üí° Key Pattern:
- **In-Degree Processing:** The pattern is to use **in-degrees** and a **queue** to systematically process nodes in an order that respects dependencies, which
  is the hallmark of BFS-based topological sort.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), Kahn's Algorithm, In-Degree, BFS, Queue, Cycle Detection

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- This algorithm is superior to the DFS method if the goal is also to detect
  cycles, as the cycle detection logic is simple: check if `result.size() < V`.
