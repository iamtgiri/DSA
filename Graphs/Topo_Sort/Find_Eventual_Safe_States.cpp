Problem: Find Eventual Safe States
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-eventual-safe-states/description/

Problem Statement:
A node is an **eventual safe state** if every possible path starting from that
node eventually leads to a terminal node (a node with no outgoing edges).
Return the indices of all eventual safe states in ascending order.

-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: For every node, perform a depth-first search (DFS) to explore all paths.
  Keep track of visited nodes within the current path to detect cycles.
- Time complexity: O(N * (N + E)), where N is the number of nodes and E is the
  number of edges. In the worst case (a dense graph), this could be
  O(N * N^2) = O(N^3) or O(N^2) if using memoization on the DFS result.
- Space complexity: O(N) for recursion stack and visited/memoization arrays.
- Limitations: Time-consuming as it re-explores subgraphs multiple times
  without proper graph structure optimization.

‚úÖ Optimized Approachs
- Idea: An eventual safe state is a node that is **not** part of a cycle and **not** on a path that leads into a cycle. The terminal nodes are the "safest" nodes,
  and safety propagates backward from them.
- Approach: **Reversed Graph Topological Sort (Kahn's Algorithm)**.
- Algorithm:
    1. **Reverse Graph:** Create a reverse graph (`rgraph`) where all edges are
       flipped (if A -> B in the original graph, then B -> A in the reverse graph).
    2. **Indegree Calculation:** Calculate the **in-degree** (`rindeg`) for the
       **original** graph. An original in-degree represents how many paths **end** at a node. Wait, no. We need the **out-degree** of the original graph,
       because terminal nodes have out-degree 0. The out-degree of the original
       graph is the **in-degree** of the reversed graph.
       Let's stick to the simplest interpretation:
       Calculate the **in-degree** (`rindeg`) on the **reversed graph**. This
       is equivalent to the **out-degree** of the original graph.
    3. **Queue Initialization:** Initialize a queue `q` with all nodes whose
       reversed in-degree (`rindeg`) is 0. These are the **original terminal nodes**.
    4. **BFS/Topological Sort:** Perform a BFS:
        - Dequeue a safe `node` and add it to the result.
        - For every predecessor `nei` in the reversed graph (i.e., a node that
          originally pointed to `node`):
            - Decrement `rindeg[nei]` (which is the original out-degree of `nei`).
            - If `rindeg[nei]` drops to 0, it means all paths originating from `nei`
              now lead to an already-found safe state (or terminal node). Enqueue `nei`.
    5. **Result:** The final set of nodes collected in the BFS are the eventual
       safe states. Sort the result ascendingly.
- Time complexity: **O(N + E)**, dominated by building the reversed graph and
  running the BFS.
- Space complexity: **O(N + E)** for the reversed graph, in-degree array, and queue.

üí° Key Pattern:
- **Safety/Terminal Propagation:** When a problem asks for states that don't lead
  to a certain problematic state (like a cycle), reversing the graph and using
  Topological Sort from the "safe" sinks is often the optimal approach.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- Directed Graph, Topological Sort, Sink Node, Cycle Detection, Kahn's Algorithm, Reversed Graph.

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- Terminal nodes are the initial safe states. Safety propagates backward along
  edges.
- This is mathematically equivalent to finding all nodes that are not part of
  a cycle and do not reach a node that is part of a cycle.
