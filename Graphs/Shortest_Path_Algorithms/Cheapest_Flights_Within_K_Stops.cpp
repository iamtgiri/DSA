Problem: Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/description/

Problem Statement:
Given n cities connected by m flights, find the cheapest price to travel
from a source city (src) to a destination city (dst) with at most k stops.
If there is no such route, return -1.

-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: Use Depth First Search (DFS) or standard recursion to explore all
  possible paths from 'src' to 'dst' that use K or fewer stops (K+1 edges),
  tracking the minimum cumulative cost.
- Time complexity: O(V^K * E) in the worst case, as the path exploration
  can branch significantly and stops are limited.
- Space complexity: O(V + E) for the graph and recursion stack.
- Limitations: Highly inefficient due to exponential path exploration.

‚úÖ Optimized Approachs
- Idea: This problem is a **Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP)** problem where
  the path length is constrained by the number of edges ($K$ stops means $\le K+1$ edges).
  This structure is perfectly solved by a **Dynamic Programming** or **Bellman-Ford** style iteration,
  where each iteration represents one flight/stop.
- Approach: **Dynamic Programming / Bellman-Ford Adaptation**.
- Algorithm:
    1. **Initialization:** Initialize a distance array `dist[V]` where `dist[i]` is
       the minimum cost to reach city `i`. Set `dist[src] = 0` and others to `INT_MAX`.
    2. **Iteration (K+1 times):** Iterate exactly $K+1$ times (representing paths
       with $0, 1, ..., K$ stops).
    3. **Relaxation:** In each iteration, create a temporary distance array (`temp_dist`)
       copied from the current `dist`. Iterate through all flights:
        - For a flight $u \to v$ with price $w$:
        - Update `temp_dist[v] = min(temp_dist[v], dist[u] + w)`.
       Using `temp_dist` ensures that we only relax edges based on costs achieved
       in the *previous* step, correctly limiting the path length by one flight per iteration.
    4. **Update:** Set `dist = temp_dist` for the next iteration.
    5. **Result:** After $K+1$ iterations, `dist[dst]` holds the cheapest price
       with at most $K$ stops.
- Time complexity: **O(K * E)**, where $K$ is the number of stops and $E$ is
  the number of flights. This is faster than standard Dijkstra's $O(E \log V)$
  if $K$ is small.
- Space complexity: **O(V + E)** for the adjacency list and distance arrays.

üí° Key Pattern:
- **Constrained Shortest Path:** When the number of edges (or stops) is limited,
  Dynamic Programming or Bellman-Ford adaptation is the efficient way to solve SSSP.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- Dynamic Programming, Bellman-Ford, SSSP, Constrained Path, Graph.

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- This approach inherently handles cycles correctly since the maximum path length
  is strictly enforced by the outer loop ($K+1$ iterations).
