Problem: Shortest path in Directed Acyclic Graph

Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/shortest-path-in-undirected-graph/1

Problem Statement:
Given a weighted, directed acyclic graph (DAG) and a source node (src),
find the shortest distance from the source node to all other nodes.
If a node is unreachable, return -1 for its distance.

-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: DFS or recursive exploration of all paths from the source to every
  other node, tracking the minimum distance.
- Time complexity: O(V!) or exponential in the worst case (e.g., dense DAG).
- Space complexity: O(V) for recursion stack and distance tracking.
- Limitations: Inefficient due to massive redundant calculations.

‚úÖ Optimized Approachs
- Idea: Since the graph is a **DAG**, we can process nodes in a **Topological Order**.
  By processing a node $u$ only after all its predecessors have been processed,
  we ensure that when we relax the edges outgoing from $u$, the distance $\text{dist}[u]$
  is already the shortest possible distance from the source. This is the fastest
  known method for SSSP in a DAG.
- Approach: **Topological Sort followed by Distance Relaxation**.
- Algorithm:
    1. **Adjacency List & Topo Sort Setup:** Build the directed, weighted adjacency list.
       Use Kahn's Algorithm (based on in-degrees and a queue) to determine the
       Topological Sort order.
    2. **Initialization:** Initialize a distance array `dist[V]` with `INT_MAX`
       (representing infinity) and set `dist[src] = 0$.
    3. **Relaxation in Order:** Iterate through the nodes in the Topological Sort order.
       For each node $u$, check if $\text{dist}[u]$ is reachable (`!= INT_MAX`). If so,
       relax all outgoing edges $(u, v)$ with weight $w$:
       $\text{dist}[v] = \min(\text{dist}[v], \text{dist}[u] + w)$.
    4. **Final Result:** Replace any remaining `INT_MAX` values in the distance array with $-1$.
- Time complexity: **O(V + E)**. Topological sort takes $O(V+E)$, and the
  subsequent relaxation phase iterates over every edge exactly once, also $O(V+E)$.
- Space complexity: **O(V + E)** for the adjacency list, in-degree array, queue,
  Topological Sort array, and distance array.

üí° Key Pattern:
- **Shortest Path in DAG (SSSP):** Always use Topological Sort + Relaxation for $O(V+E)$ speed.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), Topological Sort, Kahn's Algorithm, Relaxation,
  Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP), Directed Weighted Graph.

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- This approach works for graphs with **negative weights** as long as there are
  no negative cycles (which is guaranteed in a DAG). Dijkstra's cannot handle
  negative weights, making this method superior for DAGs.
