Problem: Directed Graph Cycle

Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/detect-cycle-in-a-directed-graph/1

Problem Statement:
Given a directed graph with V vertices and E edges, determine whether a cycle
exists in the graph.

Example:
Input: V=4, Edges=[[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: false (No cycle)
Input: V=4, Edges=[[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: true (Cycle 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: Try to enumerate all possible simple paths in the graph up to V vertices
  long and check if any path starts and ends at the same vertex.
- Time complexity: Exponential, highly inefficient, potentially O(V!).
- Space complexity: O(V + E) for storing the graph structure.
- Limitations: Infeasible for any graph with more than a handful of vertices.

‚úÖ Optimized Approach
- Idea: Use Depth First Search (DFS) and track nodes currently in the recursion
  path (recursion stack). A back edge to a node in the recursion stack indicates
  a cycle.
- Approach: Depth First Search (DFS) with state tracking.
- Algorithm:
  1. Use two arrays: `visited` (node has been seen) and `recStack` (node is in
     the current DFS path).
  2. For each unvisited node, call DFS.
  3. Inside DFS, mark the current node as visited and set `recStack` to true.
  4. If a neighbor is found to be true in `recStack`, a cycle exists.
  5. If the node finishes its traversal, unset `recStack` (backtrack).
- Time complexity: O(V + E). Every vertex and edge is processed exactly once.
- Space complexity: O(V) for the `visited` and `recStack` arrays, plus O(V) for
  the recursion stack.

üí° Key Pattern:
- Cycle detection in directed graphs: Use DFS with a recursion stack tracker.
- Cycle detection in undirected graphs: Use DFS and check for edges to an
  already-visited node, excluding the parent node.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- DFS, Directed Graph, Cycle Detection, Back Edge, Recursion Stack

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- The difference between `visited` and `recStack` is crucial: `visited` prevents
  re-processing components; `recStack` detects cycles within a component.
