Problem: Balanced Binary Tree
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/description/

Problem Statement:
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
A height-balanced binary tree is a tree in which the depth of the two
subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: For each node, recursively calculate the height of its left
  and right subtrees. If the absolute difference of their heights
  is greater than 1, the tree is not balanced. This is done for
  every node from the root down.
- Time complexity: O(N^2) in the worst case (e.g., a skewed tree),
  as the 'height' function is called repeatedly for the same nodes.
- Space complexity: O(H) for the recursion stack, where H is the
  height of the tree.
- Limitations: Inefficient due to redundant calculations.

‚úÖ Optimized Approachs
- Idea: Use a single recursive traversal (post-order) to check for
  balance and calculate the height simultaneously.
- Approach: A recursive function can return the height of the subtree
  it's currently processing. If at any point an imbalance is found,
  it returns a special value (e.g., -2) to indicate the imbalance
  and short-circuit the entire process.
- Algorithm:
    1. Define a helper function `checkBalanceAndHeight(node)`.
    2. Base case: If the node is null, return -1 (height of empty tree).
    3. Recursively call `checkBalanceAndHeight` on the left and right
       children.
    4. If the left or right call returns -2, an imbalance was already
       found, so return -2 immediately to propagate the failure.
    5. Calculate the absolute difference of the left and right heights.
    6. If the difference is > 1, the tree is unbalanced, so return -2.
    7. Otherwise, the current subtree is balanced. Return its height:
       `1 + max(left_height, right_height)`.
- Time complexity: O(N), as each node is visited only once.
- Space complexity: O(H) for the recursion stack.

üí° Key Pattern:
- Tree Traversal (post-order DFS)
- Recursion
- Combining multiple checks (height and balance) into a single pass

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- Binary Tree, Height, Balance, Recursion, DFS, LeetCode

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- (What did I learn? Similar problems? Mistakes I made?)
- I learned how a recursive function can return a special value to
  propagate an error or condition up the call stack, avoiding
  unnecessary computations.
- The brute-force approach, while intuitive, is a classic example of
  a sub-optimal recursive solution due to repeated work.
- The optimized solution is more elegant and efficient.
