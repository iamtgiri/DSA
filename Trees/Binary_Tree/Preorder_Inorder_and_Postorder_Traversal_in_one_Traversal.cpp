 * Problem: Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder Traversal in one Traversal
 * Link: URL (Not provided, but this is a common interview problem)
 *
 * Problem Statement:
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder, inorder, and postorder
 * traversals of its nodes' values in a single traversal pass.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ‚ùå Brute Force
 * - Idea: The simplest approach is to perform three separate traversals of the
 * tree: one for preorder, one for inorder, and one for postorder. This
 * can be done using either recursion or a simple iterative method for each.
 * - Time complexity: O(3N) which simplifies to O(N). Each node is visited
 * three times.
 * - Space complexity: O(3H) which simplifies to O(H), where H is the height
 * of the tree, for the recursion call stacks or auxiliary stacks.
 * - Limitations: This method is inefficient as it involves redundant tree
 * traversals, which is not optimal for large trees.
 *
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ‚úÖ Optimized Approach: Single Iterative Traversal with State Management
 * - Idea: We can combine all three traversals into a single pass by keeping
 * track of a node's "state." Each node will be processed three times: once
 * for its preorder position, once for inorder, and once for postorder. We
 * can use a stack of pairs to store both the node and its current state.
 * - Approach: We will use a stack of `pair<TreeNode*, int>`, where the integer
 * `int` represents the state of the node.
 * - State 1: The node has been visited for the first time (Preorder).
 * - State 2: The node's left subtree has been processed (Inorder).
 * - State 3: Both the node's left and right subtrees have been processed
 * (Postorder).
 * - Algorithm:
 * 1. Initialize three empty vectors: `preorder`, `inorder`, and `postorder`.
 * 2. Handle the edge case: if the root is null, return.
 * 3. Create a stack of `pair<TreeNode*, int>` and push the root with a
 * state of 1: `st.push({root, 1})`.
 * 4. Enter a `while` loop that continues as long as the stack is not empty.
 * a. Get the top pair from the stack and pop it. Let the pair be
 * `{node, state}`.
 * b. If `state == 1`:
 * - This is the first visit. Add `node->val` to the `preorder` vector.
 * - Increment the state to 2 and push the pair back onto the stack.
 * - If a left child exists, push it onto the stack with state 1.
 * c. If `state == 2`:
 * - This is the second visit, after the left subtree. Add `node->val`
 * - to the `inorder` vector.
 * - Increment the state to 3 and push the pair back onto the stack.
 * - If a right child exists, push it onto the stack with state 1.
 * d. If `state == 3`:
 * - This is the third and final visit, after both subtrees. Add
 * - `node->val` to the `postorder` vector. No need to push it back.
 * 5. The loop terminates when the stack is empty. The three vectors now hold
 * the complete traversals.
 * - Time complexity: O(N), as each node is pushed onto and popped from the
 * stack three times, for a total of a constant number of operations per node.
 * - Space complexity: O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This is for the
 * stack, and in the worst-case skewed tree, it can be O(N).
 *
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * üí° Key Pattern: State-Based Traversal
 * - This is an advanced DFS technique that uses a state variable to simulate
 * different processing stages of a single traversal. It's a powerful and
 * space-efficient way to solve problems that require multiple traversal
 * results.
 *
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords: Binary Tree, Preorder, Inorder, Postorder, Iterative, Stack,
 * Single Traversal, State Management
 *
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * üóíÔ∏è Notes
 * - (What did I learn?) This technique is an elegant solution to a common
 * problem, showing how a single iterative pass can collect all three traversal
 * types. The use of a `pair` to store state is crucial for this approach.
 * - (Similar problems?) This is a generalization of iterative preorder, inorder,
 * and postorder traversals, highlighting the underlying similarity in their
 * structure.
 * - (Mistakes I made?) Getting the state transitions or the push order for the
 * children wrong can lead to incorrect traversal results. The logic must be
 * followed precisely to maintain the correct order.
