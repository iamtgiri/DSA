 * Problem: Post-order Traversal of Binary Tree using 1 stack
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/
 *
 * Problem Statement:
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its
 * nodes' values. Implement this iteratively using a single stack.
 *
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ‚ùå Brute Force
 * - Idea: The simplest approach is recursive postorder traversal, which directly
 * implements the "Left -> Right -> Root" pattern.
 * - Time complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes.
 * - Space complexity: O(H), where H is the height of the tree for the recursion
 * call stack. In the worst case, this can be O(N).
 * - Limitations: Recursive solutions may cause a stack overflow error on very
 * deep or skewed trees.
 *
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ‚úÖ Optimized Approach: Iterative Traversal with a Single Stack
 * - Idea: Postorder traversal requires visiting a parent node after both its
 * left and right subtrees have been fully processed. With a single stack,
 * we need a way to track whether we've already handled a node's children
 * before processing the node itself.
 * - Approach: We'll use a single stack and a `lastVisited` pointer to keep
 * track of the node that was most recently added to the result. This helps
 * us decide whether to descend into a right child or to process the parent
 * node.
 * - Algorithm:
 * 1. Create an empty `result` vector and handle the edge case of a null root.
 * 2. Initialize a stack, a `curr` pointer to `root`, and a `lastVisited`
 * pointer to `nullptr`.
 * 3. Enter a `while` loop that continues as long as `curr` is not null or
 * the stack is not empty.
 * a. First, traverse as far left as possible: `while (curr != nullptr)`,
 * push `curr` onto the stack and move `curr` to `curr->left`. This saves
 * the path for backtracking.
 * b. Once at the leftmost node of a subtree, get a reference to the top
 * node on the stack (`topNode`).
 * c. Check if the right child of `topNode` exists and hasn't been visited.
 * If `topNode->right` is not null AND `topNode->right` is not equal to
 * `lastVisited`, it means we need to process the right subtree. Set `curr`
 * to `topNode->right` to descend into it.
 * d. Otherwise (if the right child is null or has already been visited),
 * we can finally process `topNode`. Pop it from the stack, add its value
 * to `result`, and update `lastVisited` to `topNode`. Set `curr` to
 * `nullptr` to avoid re-entering a loop.
 * 4. Return the `result` vector.
 * - Time complexity: O(N), as each node is visited and processed once.
 * - Space complexity: O(H), where H is the height of the tree, for the stack.
 * In the worst case (a skewed tree), the space is O(N).
 *
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * üí° Key Pattern: Single-Stack Postorder Traversal
 * - This is a sophisticated and space-efficient iterative DFS pattern. It uses
 * a "peek" operation on the stack combined with a state-tracking variable
 * (`lastVisited`) to correctly identify when a parent node can be processed.
 * It's a key interview problem that demonstrates a deep understanding of
 * iterative algorithms.
 *

 *
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * üóíÔ∏è Notes
 * - (What did I learn?) The single-stack postorder traversal is tricky. The
 * `lastVisited` pointer is essential to prevent infinite loops and ensure
 * that the right child is processed before the parent. The logic is: "If
 * the right child exists and we haven't visited it yet, go right. Otherwise,
 * we're done with the children, so process the current node."
 * - (Similar problems?) Iterative Inorder and Preorder traversals are simpler
 * variations of this iterative DFS pattern.
 * - (Mistakes I made?) Forgetting to correctly handle the `lastVisited` check is
 * a common source of errors. Also, accidentally re-entering a left subtree
 * by not setting `curr = nullptr` is another potential bug.
