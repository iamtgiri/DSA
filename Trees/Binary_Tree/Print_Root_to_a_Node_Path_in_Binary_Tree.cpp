Problem: Print Root to a Node Path in a Binary Tree
Link: https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/print-root-to-node-path-in-a-binary-tree/

Problem Statement:
Given the root of a binary tree and an integer target, return the path (as a
vector of integers) from the root to the target node. If the target node is not
present in the tree, return an empty vector.

-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: First, find the target node using a full BFS or DFS. Once found, traverse
  from the root again, explicitly checking for the target node's location to
  build the path.
- Time complexity: O(N) to find the node + O(H) to build the path. Overall O(N).
- Space complexity: O(N) to store the result, plus auxiliary space for traversal.
- Limitations: Requires storing state or performing redundant traversal.

‚úÖ Optimized Approachs
- Idea: Use **Depth First Search (DFS)** with **backtracking**. We build the path
  as we descend. When we hit the target, we stop and return success. If a branch
  fails, we remove the current node from the path (backtrack).
- Approach: Recursive DFS with Path Tracking and Backtracking
- Algorithm:
    1. Define a recursive function `findPath(node, target, path)`.
    2. Base Case: If `node` is null, return `false`.
    3. Add `node->val` to the `path` vector.
    4. Success Check: If `node->val == target`, return `true`.
    5. Recurse: Call `findPath` on left and right. If either returns `true`,
       return `true` immediately (this preserves the path).
    6. Backtrack: If the target was not found in the current branch, remove
       the current node from the path using `path.pop_back()` and return `false`.
- Time complexity: O(N). In the worst case, all nodes are visited once.
- Space complexity: O(H) for the recursion stack and O(H) for the path vector,
  where H is the height of the tree.

üí° Key Pattern:
- **DFS and Backtracking:** Recursion combined with adding/removing elements from
  a shared state (the `path` vector) is the canonical way to find a single
  solution (like a path) in a tree or graph.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- Binary Tree, DFS, Backtracking, Root-to-Node, Path Finding, Recursion

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- (What did I learn? Similar problems? Mistakes I made?)
- This pattern is crucial for many path-related problems (e.g., Path Sum II).
- The key is the `path.pop_back()` step, which ensures that nodes only remain
  in the vector if they are part of the successful root-to-target path.
