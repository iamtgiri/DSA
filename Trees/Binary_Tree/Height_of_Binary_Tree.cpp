Problem: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/description/

Problem Statement:
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the
longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: The problem is inherently a traversal problem, so there is
  no "brute-force" approach that is less efficient than a standard
  traversal. The recursive and iterative solutions are the most
  common and optimal.
- Time complexity: O(N)
- Space complexity: O(H) to O(N) depending on the tree structure.
- Limitations: None.

‚úÖ Optimized Approachs
- Idea: Two main approaches can be used:
    1. Depth-First Search (DFS) using recursion.
    2. Breadth-First Search (BFS) using a queue.
- Approach:
    - Recursive (DFS): The depth of the tree is 1 plus the maximum
      depth of its left and right subtrees. This can be solved
      recursively.
    - Iterative (BFS): Traverse the tree level by level. The number
      of levels is the maximum depth.
- Algorithm:
    - Recursive:
        1. Base case: If the root is null, return 0.
        2. Recursive step: Return 1 + max(maxDepth(root->left),
           maxDepth(root->right)).
    - Iterative:
        1. Initialize a queue with the root node.
        2. Initialize a depth counter to 0.
        3. While the queue is not empty:
            a. Increment the depth counter.
            b. Process all nodes at the current level.
            c. Add the children of the current level's nodes to the queue.
        4. Return the final depth counter.
- Time complexity: O(N) for both approaches, as every node is visited once.
- Space complexity:
    - DFS: O(H), where H is the height of the tree, for the recursion
      stack. In a skewed tree, this can be O(N).
    - BFS: O(W), where W is the maximum width of the tree, for the
      queue. In a balanced tree, this can be O(N).

üí° Key Pattern:
- Tree Traversal (DFS and BFS)
- Recursion
- Breadth-First Search (Level-Order Traversal)

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- Binary Tree, Depth, LeetCode, DFS, BFS, Traversal, Recursion

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- (What did I learn? Similar problems? Mistakes I made?)
- The iterative solution using BFS is good for finding the depth.
  I need to be careful with the loop for processing each level.
- Mistakes: I initially returned the depth inside the while loop in
  the iterative approach, causing an incorrect result. It must be
  returned after the loop completes.
