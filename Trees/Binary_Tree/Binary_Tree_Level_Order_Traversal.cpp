 * Problem: Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/description/
 *
 * Problem Statement:
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its
 * nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).
 *
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ‚ùå Brute Force
 * - Idea: The problem itself is a classic traversal. A recursive approach can be
 * devised, but it's more complex as you need to pass the level depth and
 * manage a list of lists. The iterative approach is the most natural for
 * level order traversal.
 * - Time complexity: N/A
 * - Space complexity: N/A
 * - Limitations: N/A
 *
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ‚úÖ Optimized Approach: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
 * - Idea: Level order traversal, by definition, requires visiting all nodes at
 * a given depth before moving to the next depth. This is a perfect use case
 * for a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which uses a queue to
 * explore nodes level by level.
 * - Approach: We'll use a queue to store the nodes to be visited. We'll process
 * one level at a time, adding all nodes from the current level to a temporary
 * list and then adding their children to the queue for the next level.
 * - Algorithm:
 * 1. Check for the edge case: If the `root` is `nullptr`, return an empty
 * vector of vectors.
 * 2. Create a queue `q` and push the `root` node into it.
 * 3. Create a vector of vectors `result` to store the final output.
 * 4. While the queue is not empty:
 * a. Get the current `size` of the queue. This size represents the number
 * of nodes at the current level.
 * b. Create a temporary vector `level` to store the values of the
 * current level's nodes.
 * c. Loop `size` times:
 * i. Dequeue the front node, let's call it `curr`.
 * ii. Add `curr->val` to the `level` vector.
 * iii. If `curr->left` is not `nullptr`, enqueue it.
 * iv. If `curr->right` is not `nullptr`, enqueue it.
 * d. After the loop, push the `level` vector into the `result` vector.
 * 5. Return the `result` vector.
 * - Time complexity: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit
 * and process each node exactly once.
 * - Space complexity: O(W) where W is the maximum width of the tree. This is
 * the maximum number of nodes that can be in the queue at any given time.
 * In the worst case (a complete binary tree), W can be up to N/2,
 * so the space complexity is O(N).
 *
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * üí° Key Pattern: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
 * - When a problem involves processing a tree or graph level by level, a queue-
 * based BFS approach is the most suitable pattern. It guarantees that all
 * nodes at a specific depth are explored before moving to the next depth.
 *
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords: Binary Tree, Level Order Traversal, BFS, Queue, Iterative
 *
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * üóíÔ∏è Notes
 * - (What did I learn?) The use of `q.size()` at the beginning of the `while`
 * loop is a critical trick to process nodes level by level. It ensures that
 * we only handle the nodes that were present in the queue at the start of
 * the current level's processing. Without this, the loop would process
 * nodes from multiple levels at once.
 * - (Similar problems?) Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal, Binary Tree
 * Right Side View. These are variations of BFS where the output format
 * or logic within each level changes.
 * - (Mistakes I made?) A common mistake is not using the `size` variable and
 * just looping while the queue is not empty. This would correctly traverse
 * the tree but would not separate the nodes into distinct levels.
 *
