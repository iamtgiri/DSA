Problem: Count Number of Trapezoids I
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-trapezoids-i/description/

Problem Statement:
Given a list of points in a 2D plane, count the number of trapezoids that can be
formed using these points, where the two parallel sides must be horizontal.
The result should be modulo 10^9 + 7.

-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: Iterate over all combinations of 4 points ($P_a, P_b, P_c, P_d$). Check
  if these four points can form a trapezoid with horizontal parallel sides. This
  means checking if two pairs of points share the same y-coordinate, and the
  remaining pair of points share a *different* y-coordinate.
- Time complexity: O(N^4), where N is the number of points.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Limitations: Extremely slow for large N.

‚úÖ Optimized Approachs
- Idea: A trapezoid with horizontal parallel sides is defined by selecting two
  distinct horizontal line segments (bases) from two different y-coordinates.
- Approach: Grouping and Combinatorics (Dynamic Sweeping).
- Algorithm:
    1. **Group Points:** Count the number of points at each unique y-coordinate.
       Store these counts in a sorted map (`std::map`) to ensure iteration is
       in ascending order of y-coordinate.
    2. **Calculate Segments:** For a level with $C$ points, the number of distinct
       horizontal line segments (bases) is $\binom{C}{2} = C(C-1)/2$.
    3. **Sweep and Combine:** Iterate through the y-levels in ascending order.
        a. Maintain a `cumulativePairs` count, which is the total number of
           segments from all *lower* levels (potential bottom bases).
        b. For the current level $y$, calculate its segments (`pairsAtLevel`).
        c. Each segment at level $y$ can combine with any of the `cumulativePairs`
           segments to form a trapezoid. Add $cumulativePairs \times pairsAtLevel$
           to the total `trapezoidCount`.
        d. Update `cumulativePairs` by adding `pairsAtLevel`.
    4. All calculations are performed modulo $10^9 + 7$.
- Time complexity: O(N + U log U). O(N) to count points, and $O(U \log U)$
  for map insertion and iteration, where U is the number of unique y-coordinates.
- Space complexity: O(U) to store the y-level counts.

üí° Key Pattern:
- **Geometric Counting with Combinations:** Reducing a complex geometric counting
  problem to a combinations problem ($\binom{N}{2}$) and a dynamic programming
  style sweep.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- Combinatorics, Geometry, Horizontal Lines, Sorted Map, Combinations.

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- Using `std::map` instead of `std::unordered_map` is crucial to ensure the
  y-coordinates are processed in ascending order, guaranteeing that the
  `cumulativePairs` only includes lower levels.
