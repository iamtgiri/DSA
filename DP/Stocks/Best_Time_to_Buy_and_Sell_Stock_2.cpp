Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/

Problem Statement:
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a stock on day i.
You can buy and sell the stock multiple times but can hold at most one share at a time.
Find the maximum profit you can achieve.

-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: Try all possible sequences of buy/sell transactions recursively.
- Time complexity: O(2^n)
- Space complexity: O(n) recursion stack
- Limitations: Exponential time, impractical for large n.

‚úÖ Optimized Approach 1 (Greedy)
- Idea: Add up all positive differences between consecutive days.
  Buy whenever the next day's price is higher than today.
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)

‚úÖ Optimized Approach 2 (DP)
- Idea: Keep track of two states:
  1. hold[i] = max profit if holding a stock on day i
  2. cash[i] = max profit if not holding a stock on day i
- Transition:
    hold[i] = max(hold[i-1], cash[i-1] - price[i])
    cash[i] = max(cash[i-1], hold[i-1] + price[i])
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n) ‚Üí can be optimized to O(1)

üí° Key Pattern:
- Single pass greedy works because multiple transactions can be split into consecutive profitable differences.
- DP is useful when there are additional constraints like cooldowns or transaction fees.

Keywords:
- DP on sequences
- Greedy
- Stock problems
