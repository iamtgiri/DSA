Problem: Edit Distance
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/

Problem Statement:
Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations
required to convert word1 to word2 using insert, delete, or replace operations.

Example 1:
    Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 
        horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
        rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
        rose -> ros (remove 'e')

Example 2:
    Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
    Output: 5
    Explanation: 
        intention -> inention (remove 't')
        inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
        enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
        exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
        exection -> execution (insert 'u')
-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: Try all possible operations at each step recursively.
- Time complexity: Exponential
- Space complexity: O(max(n,m)) recursion stack
- Limitations: Too slow for large strings

‚úÖ Optimized Approach (DP)
- Idea: Use a 2D DP table where dp[i][j] stores the minimum number of operations
  required to convert word1[0..i-1] to word2[0..j-1].
  Fill the table iteratively using previously computed subproblems.
- Time complexity: O(n * m)
- Space complexity: O(n * m)

üí° Connection to LCS:
- LCS represents the part of the strings that do NOT need any change.
- Characters NOT in LCS are candidates for insert, delete or replace.
- DP builds on this idea to efficiently compute the minimum edits.

üí° Key Pattern:
- 2D DP on sequences with character comparisons and allowed operations.
