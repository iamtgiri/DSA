Problem: Deleting a node in LinkedList
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/description/

Problem Statement:
Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
The node to be deleted is guaranteed not to be the tail.

-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: This problem fundamentally requires access to the preceding node to perform a true deletion (changing the predecessor's `next` pointer). Since the problem constraints *prevent* this, a brute-force approach (standard deletion) is impossible under the given setup.
- Time complexity: N/A
- Space complexity: N/A
- Limitations: Cannot access the head or previous node.

‚úÖ Optimized Approachs
- Idea: Since we cannot change the `next` pointer of the node *before* the target node, we must overwrite the target node's data with the data of the next node, effectively deleting the *next* node in the chain. The target node itself becomes a copy of its successor.
- Approach: Overwrite and Bypass.
- Algorithm:
    1. Identify the node immediately following the target node: `nextNode = node->next`.
    2. Copy the value of `nextNode` into the target node: `node->val = nextNode->val`. This visually 'deletes' the target node's original value.
    3. Bypass `nextNode` by setting the target node's `next` pointer to point to the node *after* `nextNode`: `node->next = nextNode->next`.
    4. Free the memory of the actual node that was bypassed (`nextNode`). (Although LeetCode environments usually omit the explicit `delete nextNode` for simplicity, it's good practice in C++).
- Time complexity: O(1). Only a few pointer reassignments and one data copy are performed.
- Space complexity: O(1). No extra memory is allocated proportional to the input size.

üí° Key Pattern:
- **Linked List Deletion Without Predecessor:** This is a specific trick for linked list deletion when you are *only* given the target node, leveraging the constraint that the target is never the tail.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- Linked List, In-place, O(1) Time, Node Deletion, Pointer Manipulation.

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- This technique is an exception to standard linked list operations. It doesn't truly delete the memory of the original node; instead, it deletes the data/links of the *next* node and frees its memory, while logically presenting the desired result. The original node is still present but now holds the successor's data.
