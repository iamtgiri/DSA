# DSA

This repository contains my practice code for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
It includes solutions to common problems, algorithm implementations and various coding exercises to improve problem-solving skills.

## Structure

- **Arrays/** â€“ Array problems and solutions  
- **LinkedLists/** â€“ Singly and doubly linked list implementations  
- **StacksQueues/** â€“ Stack and queue implementations and problems  
- **Trees/** â€“ Binary trees, BSTs, and tree algorithms  
- **Graphs/** â€“ Graph representations and traversal algorithms  
- **DP/** â€“ Dynamic Programming problems and solutions  
- **Recursion/** â€“ Recursive problem-solving approaches  

## Languages

- Primarily **C++**
- May include other languages (Python) occasionally

## Usage

Clone this repository and use it as a reference for practicing DSA problems:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamtgiri/DSA.git
```

## Contribution

This is primarily a personal practice repo, but contributions are welcome!
Feel free to submit issues or pull requests for improvements.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
