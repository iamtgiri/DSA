Problem: Lemonade Change
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/
Problem Statement: At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. Customers are paying 
with $5, $10, and $20 bills. You must provide correct change. You start with no money.
 Return true if you can provide change to all customers, or false otherwise.

-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: This problem does not lend itself well to a brute-force approach. There are no 
  "combinations" to check, as the process is sequential. We must handle each transaction 
  as it comes, making the best choice at each step.
- Time complexity: Not applicable/Infeasible.
- Space complexity: Not applicable/Infeasible.
- Limitations: A recursive or exhaustive search would be pointless and over-complicated.

‚úÖ Optimized Approach
- Idea: The most efficient approach is a greedy algorithm. We process customers one by one
  and keep a running count of the $5 and $10 bills we have on hand.
- Approach: A greedy algorithm.
- Algorithm:
  1. Initialize counters for the number of $5 bills and $10 bills to zero.
  2. Iterate through each customer's payment in the `bills` array.
  3. If the payment is $5, increment the count of $5 bills.
  4. If the payment is $10, we must provide $5 in change. Check if a $5 bill is available.
     If so, decrement the $5 bill count and increment the $10 bill count. If not, it's impossible
     to give change, so return `false`.
  5. If the payment is $20, we need to provide $15 in change. The greedy strategy is to use one $10
     bill and one $5 bill first, as $10 bills are less flexible than $5 bills for making smaller change.
     If this combination is available, use it. Otherwise, if we have at least three $5 bills, use them.
     If neither option is possible, return `false`. After giving change, increment the $20 bill count
     (though this is not strictly necessary as we don't need to give change for a $20 bill later, keeping
     a count of $5s and $10s is sufficient).
  6. If the loop completes without returning `false`, it means all customers were successfully served,
     so return `true`.
- Time complexity: O(N), where N is the number of customers, as we iterate through the `bills` vector once.
- Space complexity: O(1) as we only use a few integer variables to store the counts of $5 and $10 bills.

üí° Key Pattern:
- **Greedy Algorithms**: The problem has the greedy-choice property. At each step, making the locally
  optimal choice (using a $10 bill for change before $5 bills) leads to a globally optimal solution.
  This is because a $10 bill can only be used to make change for a $20 bill, whereas a $5 bill is more versatile.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- Greedy Algorithm, Change Making, LeetCode, Simulation

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- The greedy approach works because the denominations are chosen carefully. Specifically, for a $20 bill,
  giving change of $10 + $5 is always better than $5 + $5 + $5, because it conserves the more useful $5 bills.
