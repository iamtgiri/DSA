Problem: Assign Cookies
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/

Problem Statement:
------------------
Each child has a "greed factor" g[i], representing the minimum size of cookie 
they need to be satisfied. Each cookie has a size s[j]. A child can receive 
at most one cookie, and a cookie can be given to at most one child.

Goal: Maximize the number of satisfied children.

-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: Try all assignments of cookies to children.
- Time complexity: O(n! * m!), infeasible.
- Space complexity: O(1).
- Limitations: Exponential explosion.

‚úÖ Optimized Approach (Greedy + Sorting)
- Idea:
  1. Sort both greed factors and cookie sizes.
  2. Use two pointers: one for children, one for cookies.
  3. Assign the smallest cookie that can satisfy the current child.
  4. Move to next child when satisfied; otherwise, try the next bigger cookie.
- Time complexity: O(n log n + m log m) for sorting + O(n + m).
- Space complexity: O(1).

üí° Key Pattern:
- Greedy matching with two pointers.
- Similar to "Interval Scheduling" / "Activity Selection".

Keywords:
- Greedy
- Two Pointers
- Sorting

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- Don't waste large cookies on less greedy children.
- Sorting enables optimal greedy matching.
