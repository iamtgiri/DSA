Problem: Insert Interval
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/

Problem Statement:
You are given a sorted array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals`. You are
also given a `newInterval`. Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that the
resulting array is still sorted and non-overlapping. Merge overlapping intervals
if necessary.

Example 1:
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
Explanation: The new interval [2,5] overlaps with [1,3], so they are merged.

Example 2:
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: The new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5], [6,7], and [8,10].
-------------------------------------------------
‚ùå Brute Force
- Idea: A brute-force approach would be to first insert the `newInterval` into
the array, and then use a separate algorithm (like the one for "Merge Intervals")
to merge all overlapping intervals.
- Time complexity: O(N log N) if the sorting step is required.
- Space complexity: O(N) to store the new array.
- Limitations: This is not the most efficient method because it doesn't
leverage the pre-sorted nature of the input.

‚úÖ Optimized Approach
- Idea: Since the input `intervals` array is already sorted and non-overlapping, we
can process the insertion and merging in a single linear pass. This is a greedy
approach that handles three distinct phases: before the overlap, during the
overlap, and after the overlap.
- Approach: A greedy, single-pass algorithm.
- Algorithm:
  1. Initialize a result array `ans`.
  2. **Phase 1: Add non-overlapping intervals before `newInterval`**. Iterate
  through `intervals` and add any interval that ends before `newInterval` starts
  (i.e., `intervals[i][1] < newInterval[0]`) to `ans`.
  3. **Phase 2: Merge overlapping intervals**. Iterate through `intervals` as long
  as an overlap exists (i.e., `intervals[i][0] <= newInterval[1]`). For each
  overlap, expand `newInterval` by taking the minimum of the start times and the
  maximum of the end times.
  4. **Phase 3: Add the merged interval and remaining intervals**. After the loop
  from Phase 2, the `newInterval` will be updated to its final, merged form. Add this
  merged `newInterval` to `ans`. Then, add all remaining intervals from the original
  array to `ans`.
- Time complexity: O(N) because we iterate through the `intervals` array only
once.
- Space complexity: O(N) to store the new array.

üí° Key Pattern:
- **Interval Problems with Sorting**: The sorted nature of the input is a critical
clue. It allows us to process the intervals linearly and make local greedy
decisions (to merge or not) that lead to a globally optimal solution.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Keywords:
- Greedy Algorithm, Interval Problems, Sorting, Linear Scan, Two Pointers

üóíÔ∏è Notes
- The "Merge Intervals" problem is a good prerequisite for this one, as the
merging logic is a core part of the solution.
